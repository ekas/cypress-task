# Grid Singularity Cypress Assignment

## Project Build Instructions

Make sure you've [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) & [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.

Open terminal and follow these steps;

- Step 1: Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekas/cypress-task
```

You should now see a `cypress-task` folder in your present working directory. Let's change directory to it.

```bash
cd cypress-task/
```

- Step 2: Install dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

This will use `npm` that is included with `nodejs` to install project dependencies.

- Step 3: Start the cypress app.

```bash
yarn run cypress open
```

- Step 4: Select task `Login.feature` run in cypress app.
